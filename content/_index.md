My name is Ben. I am currently interested in algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory. This page will hopefully include everything that I learn during my master's degree, including my reading over the summer to prepare for it. 

Table of Contents:
- [Complex Analysis](notes/Complex%20Analysis/Complex%20Analysis.md)
- [Representation Theory](notes/Representation%20Theory/Representation%20Theory.md)
- [Algebraic Geometry](notes/Algebraic%20Geometry/Algebraic%20Geometry.md)
- [Commutative Algebra](notes/Commutative%20Algebra/Commutative%20Algebra.md)
