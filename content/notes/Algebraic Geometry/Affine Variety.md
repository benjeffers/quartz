**Definition (Affine Variety).** An *affine algebraic variety*, or an *affine variety*, is an [irreducible](notes/Algebraic%20Geometry/Irreducible%20Spaces.md) [algebraic set](notes/Algebraic%20Geometry/Algebraic%20Sets.md) in $\mathbb A^n$. An open set of an affine variety is called a *quasi-affine variety*.
