Throughout this note fix $k$ to be an algebraically closed field, this could be $\mathbb C, \overline{\mathbb Q}, \overline{\mathbb{F}_p}$ etc. 

**Definition (Affine $n$-space).** *Affine $n$-space* over $k$, denoted $\mathbb A\_k^n$ or just $\mathbb A^n$, is the space of all $n$-tuples of elements of $k$. An element $P \in \mathbb A^n$ we be called a *point*, and if $P = (a\_1, \ldots , a\_n)$ with $a\_i \in k$, then the $a\_i$ will be called the *coordinates* of $P$. 

We don't just denote affine $n$-space by $k^n$ because soon we will endow $\mathbb A^n$ with more structure, namely a topology. 

Let $A = k[x\_1, \ldots , x\_n]$ be the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over $k$. We will interpret the elements of $A$ as functions from $\mathbb A^n$ to $k$ by defining $f(P) = f(a\_1, \ldots , a\_n)$ where $f \in A$ and $P \in \mathbb A^n$. 

**Definition (Zero Set).** If $f \in A$ is a polynomial, we can talk about the *zeros* of $f$, namely the set 
$$
Z(f) = \lbrace P \in \mathbb A^n \mid f(P) = 0 \rbrace.
$$More generally, if $T$ is any subset of $A$, we define the *zero set* of $T$ to be the common zeros of all the elements of $T$, namely 
$$
Z(T) = \lbrace P \in \mathbb A^n \mid f(P) = 0 \text{ for all } f \in T \rbrace. 
$$

It is important to note that if $\mathfrak a = \langle T \rangle$ is the ideal generated by $T$, then $Z(\mathfrak a) = Z(T)$. Furthermore, since $A$ is a Noetherian ring by the [Hilbert Basis Theorem](notes/Commutative%20Algebra/Hilbert%20Basis%20Theorem.md), $\mathfrak a$ has a finite set of generators $f_1, \ldots , f_r$. To see the equality of the two sets first let $P \in Z(T)$. Then for any $g = \sum\_{i=1}^r a\_i f\_i$ we have 
$$
g(P) = \sum\_{i=1}^r a\_if\_i(P) = 0 
$$
so $P \in Z(\mathfrak a)$. Now if $P \in Z(\mathfrak a)$, since each $f \in T$ is also in $\mathfrak a$, we must have $f(P) = 0$ for all $f \in T$. Thus the sets are equal. So we will only refer to $Z(\mathfrak a)$ where $\mathfrak a \subset A$ is an ideal, and it can be thought of as the common set of zeros of the generators of $\mathfrak a$. 

**Definition (Closed Algebraic Set).** A subset $Y$ of $\mathbb A^n$ is a *closed algebraic set* if there exists a subset $T \subseteq A$ such that $Y = Z(T)$. 

**Examples.**
1. The polynomial ring $k\[x\]$ is a PID, i.e., every ideal is generated by one element. So if $\mathfrak a$ is an ideal in $k\[x\]$, then $\mathfrak a = (f(x))$. Because polynomials in one variable have only finitely many zeros, the closed algebraic sets of $\mathbb A\^1$ are just the finite subsets of $\mathbb A\^1$. 
2. The traditional conic sections are closed algebraic sets in $\mathbb A^2$, i.e., polynomials of the form $ax^2 + by^2 + cxy + dx + ey + f$. For instance the zeros of $y-x^2$ form a parabola and $xy-1$ gives a hyperbola. 
3. The *Clebsch diagonal cubic* is a surface in $\mathbb A\_{\mathbb C}^3$ given by the equation $$x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 1 = (x+y+z+1)^3.$$
Now we will explore a couple of properties of closed algebraic sets. 

**Proposition.** If $\mathfrak b \subset \mathfrak a$, then, $Z(\mathfrak a) \subset Z(\mathfrak b)$.

*Proof.* If $P \in Z(\mathfrak a)$ and $f \in \mathfrak b$, then since $f \in \mathfrak a$ as well, $f(P) = 0$, so $P \in Z(\mathfrak b)$.

**Proposition.** If $\mathfrak a \subset k\[x\_1, \ldots, x\_n \]$ is an ideal, then $Z(\mathfrak a) = Z(\sqrt{\mathfrak a})$. 

*Proof.* Let $n \in \N$. Then $\mathfrak a^n = \lbrace \sum f\_1 \cdots f\_n \mid f\_i \in \mathfrak a \rbrace \subseteq \mathfrak a$ .So by the above proposition $Z(\mathfrak a) \subseteq Z(\mathfrak a^n)$. Now let $P \in Z(\mathfrak a^n)$. Since $f^n \in \mathfrak a^n$ whenever $f \in \mathfrak a$, we have that $0 = f^n(P) = (f(P))^n$. Since $k$ is an integral domain this implies that $f(P) = 0$ and $P \in Z(\mathfrak a)$. Thus putting this together for all $n \in \N$ gives $Z(\mathfrak a) = Z(\mathfrak a^n)$.
